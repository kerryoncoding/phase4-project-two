         <h2>ABOUT</h2>
         <p>I have a strong background in mechanical engineering and have been developing consumer, industrial and medical products for over 15 years.  I have touched on all aspects of product development from initial concept through to manufacturing. I love to see a design evolve into a product. A few examples of what I have worked on are shown on the Projects page.</p>
